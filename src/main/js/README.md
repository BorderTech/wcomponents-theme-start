# JavaScript sources

JavaScript files go here. If you do not need to add JavaScript you may delete this entire directory.

To completely override a WComponents JavaScript file (which is not recommended) use a file with the
same name. To add new JavaScript use a new file name.

The requirejs path to files in this directory is defined as `"wc/"`.
